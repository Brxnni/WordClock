# WordClock
Clock that describes the time with words, made of letters that turn off and on over the course of the day. (Can only show down to nearest 5 minute mark)
Supports German and English.

[Check it out here!](https://brxnni.github.io/WordClock/src/?language=EN)

(Change the `language` parameter in the URL from `EN` to `DE` to view the German version! ) 

(If you can't see the flag, perhaps you should download my cool [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/Brxnni/ChromeFlagEmojis)! which is not on the chrome store yet because im lazy)

## TODO

* Change behaviour so it does not say "twenty to 5" at 16:38 and instead says "twentyfive to 5"
  * Add little dots to make the above point work
